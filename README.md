### School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to remove the ninth grade students accused of cheating at Thomas High School from our dataset to see how this affected our results for both the school and district summaries. 

# Results
The district summary is affected in that there are now a smaller number of students (due to removed ninth graders from Thomas High School). The metrics for Average Reading/Math Score, and passing percentages for reading, math, and overall were slightly changed. The average math and reading scores decreased slightly, as did passing percentage for math. The district passing percentage for reading and overall passing percentage increased slightly. 


The results for Thomas High School are affected, with passing percentages for math, reading, and overall all falling (but only very slightly). Removing the ninth graders from the dataset does not change the standing of THS relative to other schools, as it still ranks second in terms of performance after removing the ninth grade students.
